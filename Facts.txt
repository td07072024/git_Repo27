The Varaha Purana (Sanskrit: वराह पुराण, Varāha Purāṇa) is a Sanskrit text from the Puranas genre of literature in Hinduism.[1] It belongs to the Vaishnavism literature corpus praising Narayana (Vishnu), but includes chapters dedicated to praising and centered on Shiva and Shakti (goddesses it calls Brahmi, Vaishnavi and Raudri).[1][2]

The text exists in many versions, with major sections lost to history.[2] The text has been estimated to have been first completed between the 10th and 12th centuries, and continuously revised thereafter.[2][3] The surviving manuscripts of this text are notable, like Linga Purana, because they do not cover the required Panchalakshana (five characteristics) expected in a Purana.[2] Scholars have questioned whether it really qualifies as a Purana, and whether the extant manuscripts are merely a religious manual largely focussed on Vaishnava practices,[3][4] with sections that also praise Shiva, Shakti and other gods in a secular way.[1][2]

The Varaha Purana includes mythology, particularly of the Varaha incarnation (avatar) of Vishnu rescuing the earth (Prithvi) at the time of a great flood.[2][5] The text also includes mythology of goddesses and Shiva,[4] and a discussion of Karma and Dharma called Dharmasamhita.[6] A large portion of the text is dedicated to medieval geographic Mahatmya (tourist guides)[7] to temples and sites in Mathura and Nepal, but it curiously lacks adoring Krishna in Mathura-related section of the type found in other Puranas.[6][8]
