The century in which Varaha Purana was composed is unknown. Wilson suggested 12th-century, during the period of Ramanuja influence.[6] Most scholars concur that this is a relatively late Purana,[3] and a few suggest that the first version of this text was complete by the 10th century.[6] The text is named after the Varaha (boar) avatar of Vishnu, wherein he rescues goddess earth.[4]

The text is mentioned and summarized in the manuscripts of the Matsya Purana, Skanda Purana and the Agni Purana, but the description of this text in those documents suggests that surviving manuscripts of Varaha Purana are entirely different from what it once was.[9][10] The text exists in many versions, with significant variations.[2][11]

The Padma Purana categorizes Varaha Purana as a Sattva Purana.[12] Scholars consider the Sattva-Rajas-Tamas classification as "entirely fanciful" and there is nothing in this text that actually justifies this classification.[13]
